//! Discovery: find the game's objects by class, in the heap.
//!
//! A polymorphic object names its class through its vtable, so an object is found by sweeping
//! memory for the vtables of the classes wanted (`rtti`). The heap is swept a chunk at a time with
//! a callback between chunks so polling carries on (spike 59), and where it is is measured again
//! now and then: it grows after boot and when a battle starts.
//!
//! A sweep reads the whole heap, and costs about a quarter of a second. What the game has allocated
//! since is found where it allocated it (`pa3ds.core.heaps`), and only that memory is swept
//! (`Discovery.sweep_spans`, ADR-0034). Until then a sweep between whole sweeps read the spans
//! around what earlier sweeps had found (spikes 69 and 70).
//!
//! The linear heap is not swept. It is eight times bigger, and what the runtime needs from it, the
//! battle's layouts, is reached from a message window's handle into their pool (spike 64). A
//! rolling sweep of it, a slice at a time, was a sixth of the runtime's time until 2026-09-17.
//!
//! Nothing here knows the game. What to look for, and what to do with what was found, is the
//! profile's.
//!
//! Bound by:
//! - ADR-0003: objects are found by their class and checked by a validator, never at an address
//!   written down.
//! - ADR-0034: a sweep may be partial: a reader adds what it finds and forgets nothing for its
//!   absence.
