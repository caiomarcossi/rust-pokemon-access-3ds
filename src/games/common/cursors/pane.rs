//! Sun draws a ninth (spike 112), for every menu read so far — the title's, the X menu, the options
//! and the save prompt's Yes and No: a **cursor pane**, a plain pane alone under the root of a layout
//! of its own holding only the arrow's pictures, which the game moves and sizes onto the chosen item.
//! Each of the menu's buttons keeps an empty pane of exactly that place and size, and the item is
//! that button: all its words, as the title's Continue says the name, place and play time beside it.
//! Where the buttons' own panes are hidden and never placed, as the Yes and No's are, the item is
//! the words inside the cursor pane, as an app menu's cursor window's is. The talk window's answers
//! are pointed at as the Poké Mart's boxes' are, by a picture beside the words on its row, known by
//! where it stands, alone in a plain pane in the answers' window, since Sun's layout files are not
//! read to name its texture.
