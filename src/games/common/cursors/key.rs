//! The name entry's keyboard draws a third kind (spike 68): each key is a picture holding its letter
//! and an `nw::lyt::Bounding` touch area, and the cursor is a picture the game moves into the chosen
//! key's touch area. The item is the key's words, or, for a key drawn without any — the one that
//! confirms the name — the words of its picture's texture, as a battle button's are.
//!
//! Bound by:
//! - ADR-0014: the key under the cursor, a capital as "Cap O", and the letters left after one is
//!   deleted.
