//! The language choice Sun opens a new game with, and the confirmation after it.
//!
//! ```text
//! App::LangSelect::LangSelectUpperDraw
//!     +0xb4  u8 the screen: 0 the list of languages, 1 "Selected language" and its two choices
//!     +0x12c u8 the language under the cursor, in the list's order, 0 to 8
//!     +0x12d u8 the choice under the cursor: 0 "Begin game", 1 "Select language"
//! ```
//!
//! Read in spike 111 over sun_2.ctm, a picture taken each time the word changed: every press moved
//! the language a step, English 0 to 繁體中文 8, and each matched the language by the arrow.
//!
//! The list's buttons are pictures, each language's name in its own script, and no word of them is in
//! memory. The game's own words for them are the English names in its system text, file 51, in the
//! list's order — the words "Selected language" shows the choice by — and the rest of what the two
//! screens say is there too: the title over the list, the confirmation's two choices, and the
//! instructions on the bottom screen.
