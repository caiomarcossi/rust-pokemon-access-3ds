//! Sun's walls out of the player's ROM: which cells of an area can be walked on foot (spike 114).
//!
//! Sun has no cell table. What the player walks on and walks into are triangle meshes, one set to a
//! **map block** of the world, 4,200 world units square, and an area lists the blocks the game
//! keeps loaded while the player is in it: its own and those around it, so the tables of two areas
//! side by side share blocks.
//!
//! **Block table** — an area's third file of `a/0/8/2` ('TR'), a pack of one:
//!
//! ```text
//! +0x00 u32 width and u32 height in blocks, u32 a block's side in world units (4,200), u32 0,
//!       u32 how many alternates follow the table
//! +0x14 width x height records of 12 bytes, a row at a time from the north-west:
//!       +0x00 u16 the block's file in `a/0/8/6`, 0xffff for none; the rest is not read
//! then the alternates, 12 bytes each: u32 a record, u16 its number, u16 another file
//! ```
//!
//! Block (x, z) of the table starts at world x times 4,200 and z times 4,200. The player's bedroom
//! is block (0, 0) of area 21's table, Route 1 beside the house block (6, 4) of area 0's, and Iki
//! Town block (4, 3) of area 1's. Which alternate the game loads is not known, so the first file is
//! read.
//!
//! **Map block** — a file of `a/0/8/6`, a 'BG' pack of eight: 0 the block's model (`gfmodel`), 1 to
//! 5 empty, 6 the floor mesh, 7 a 'BG' pack of four wall meshes. Wall mesh 0 is every wall, fence
//! and cliff; 1 runs along the edge of the sea; 2 is short boxes with lids, one of them round a
//! warp a person stands in the way of; 3 was empty in every block read.
//!
//! **Mesh** — `00 05 12 14`, u32 count, then that many triangles of 0x48 bytes: three corners (f32
//! x, y, z, 1), the normal (f32 x, y, z, 0), u32 the ground's kind (tall grass 31 and the open sea
//! 8 outdoors, 0xffffffff on a wall), and a u32 of flags that is not read.
//!
//! A cell is `field.CELL` world units, so a block is 84 cells a side. A cell is **open** where some
//! floor lies under it, at any of nine points spread over it, and no wall comes within half a cell
//! of its centre. Half a cell is the least that keeps a way from stepping through a wall: a wall
//! between two cells' centres is less than half a cell from one of them, unless it crosses exactly
//! halfway. A cell of the area's blocks with no floor under it is closed; a cell in none of them is
//! not known.
//!
//! **Heights** (spike 120). A cell can hold more than one **floor**, each a range of heights: the
//! ground and a porch's deck over it, a town's edge and the route below it. Floors under one point
//! less than `STEP` apart are one floor; a floor with another less than `HEADROOM` above it is
//! covered, and not stood on, as the ground under a deck is. A wall closes only the floors it rises
//! above and starts below `HEADROOM` over: outdoors every wall runs from y -1,600 to 1,700 and
//! closes them all, indoors 0 to 400 or 600. Two neighbouring cells' floors are walked between
//! only where they come within `STEP` of each other, so a drop with no wall along it — Iki Town's
//! edge above Route 1, 189 units — joins nothing, and a **pocket** is the floors so joined. Where
//! two cells side by side hold floors of one pocket that do not join — the way down to the route
//! runs round by the stairs — one of the two is closed in the chunks P walks: the one whose floor
//! is further from the player's.
