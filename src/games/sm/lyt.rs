//! Sun's NintendoWare panes: where its `nw::lyt` keeps the fields ORAS's keeps elsewhere.
//!
//! Everything else about a layout is ORAS's (`games.common.lyt`): a pane's tree links at +0x04 to
//! +0x14, a Layout's root at +0x10 and width at +0x18, and Game Freak's work, found through the
//! `nw::lyt::DrawInfo` it embeds at +0x14, alive at +0x04, drawn at +0x07, its Layout at +0x10 and
//! the DrawInfo's projection at +0x28, -0.005 on the top screen and -0.00625 on the bottom. A work
//! is a heap block of its own, 0x134 bytes. What moved (spike 112, sun_3.ctm, over the title's
//! Continue, the X menu, the options and the save prompt, each piece checked against a picture):
//!
//! ```text
//! Pane      +0x3c f32 width    +0x40 f32 height
//!           +0x44 u8 flags, bit 0 visible    +0x45 u8 alpha    +0x46 u8 global alpha
//!           +0x47 u8 anchor, the low two bits: 0 centre, 1 left, 2 right
//!           +0x48 the global matrix: +0x48 f32 scale x, +0x54 f32 x, +0x5c f32 scale y,
//!           +0x64 f32 y
//!           +0x80 char[16] name
//! TextBox   +0xa4 -> text    +0xb8 f32 glyph width    +0xc8 -> tag processor
//!           +0xcc u16 capacity    +0xce u16 length
//!           +0xd1 u8 text position, the low two bits: 0 centre, 1 left, 2 right
//! ```
//!
//! The objects are smaller than ORAS's, and every read of one stops at its end, since the block
//! after it may be the GPU's (ADR-0035): a Pane or a Bounding is 0xa4 bytes, the smallest pane, and
//! a TextBox 0x100, each 0x20 bytes into a heap block of its own.
