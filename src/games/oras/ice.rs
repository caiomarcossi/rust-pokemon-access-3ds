//! Sootopolis Gym's rooms of thin ice: a tile cracks as the player steps onto it, and gives way
//! under the next step onto it (spike 167).
//!
//! The Gym loads a module of its own, `DllUSGymWater.cro`, whose
//! `field::FieldUniqueSequenceGymWater` checks the player's cell against three rooms at every
//! step. The module's image is mapped whole, the sequence's vtable at `VTABLE` in it, and two
//! words of its code hold where the loader put what the rooms are read from: `SOLID_AT` the cells
//! of the rooms that are no ice, `NO_ICE` pairs of u32 x and z, and `DATA_AT` the module's data,
//! whose first three words point to the rooms, the top room first:
//!
//! ```text
//! +0x00 u8 width, u8 height, u8 x and u8 z of the north-west cell
//! +0x04 i32 the floor's height in world units
//! +0x08 u16 the work value that is 1 once the room is cleared
//! +0x0c -> a byte a cell, row by row: low two bits 0 whole, 1 cracked (and the floor that is
//!          no ice, which is never stepped on as ice)
//! +0x10 -> the room's three exits, pairs of u32 x and z, in the module's own image after the
//!          cells that are no ice
//! +0x18 u8  1 once the room is cleared
//! ```
//!
//! A step onto a whole tile sets it to 1; a step onto a cracked one drops the player to the floor
//! below, and the room is whole again. Once every tile is 1, a step onto an exit clears the room,
//! and the module looks at it no more. The game names none of it.
