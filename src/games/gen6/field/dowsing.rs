//! The Dowsing Machine's lights: what the machine the player holds out shows of a hidden item.
//!
//! The machine is drawn in the player's hands on the field, not on the bottom screen. Its two lights
//! come on only while the player faces a hidden item near enough, and their colour says how near:
//! blue, green, yellow, then red with the item in the cell in front (omega_ruby_item-finder.ctm,
//! 2026-09-29). X's machine shoots two beams the way the player faces instead, in the same four
//! colours at the same levels (x_route_8_dowsing, spike A). The game keeps what they show in a small
//! record of no class of its own, reached from the field's process through the field's work, which
//! has no class either:
//!
//! ```text
//! process (`field::FieldmapProc`)  +0x24 -> the field's work
//! work                             +0x1d0 in ORAS, +0x1ac in X -> the record (`Game.dowsing`)
//! record  +0x00 -> the work    +0x08 u32 1 with the item in front    +0x0c u32 a timer
//!         +0x10 u32 the lights: 0 off, 1 blue, 2 green, 3 yellow, 4 red
//!         +0x14 s32 x and +0x18 s32 z, the cell of the item they show; -1 while they are off
//! ```
//!
//! Turning or stepping, the level can read another value for a frame or two before it settles, so it
//! is said once two polls have read it. Where the item is stays unsaid, since the game shows only
//! the colour and which way the player faces (ADR-0017).
