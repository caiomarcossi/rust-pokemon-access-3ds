//! The game's button managers, which say whose buttons take taps now (spike 189).
//!
//! An app's buttons are answered through `app::tool::ButtonManager`s, each holding buttons in a
//! layout or two. A manager's update returns at once while its byte +0x24 is set, and the game sets
//! it to lock a screen's buttons under a menu: the party's list under "Do what with Blaze?"
//! (movie22). A layout whose every manager is locked takes no tap, however bright it is drawn.
//!
//! An app's bottom bar is a **touch bar** instead, a view of a class of the app's module's own
//! (`app::pokelist::TouchBar`, `app::bag::TouchBar`) built on the executable's
//! `app::ui::UITouchBarView`: it updates the manager at its +0x10 only while its byte +0x2d is set,
//! which the party clears under its menu too, the manager's own lock left open. The field's PokéNav
//! has no manager at all, and the PC Box keeps its grid's open under "Continue operations?": a list
//! window is answered first (`touch.answered_first`).
//!
//! ```text
//! manager    +0x10  its buttons, a pointer each; +0x14 how many
//!            +0x24  locked
//! button     +0x08  a handle, whose +0x04 is its layout's work
//!            +0x10  the number of its touch area in that layout, or of its picture where it has
//!                   none, which the pane is named by in base 36: 0x111 is "7l"
//!            +0x35  it takes taps
//! touch bar  +0x10  its manager
//!            +0x14  its input listener, inside the touch bar itself
//!            +0x2d  it takes input
//! field menu +0x7c  its manager (X's +0x70, `Game.field_menu`)
//!            +0x9c  an app of the bottom screen has the input (X's +0x90)
//! ```
//!
//! Super Training's page locks no manager (spike B, or_super_train): it switches its buttons off one
//! by one. Under its Use panel the party, the training-bags button and Super Training read 0 at +0x35
//! and the bags 1, and a tap on a bag chose it while a tap on a party member did nothing; under its
//! Yes and No only those two and the bag chosen read 1, and taps on the bag chosen, a party member
//! and POKÉMON did nothing. A button switched off is left out, as a layout no button of which takes
//! taps is.
//!
//! The frame round the PlayNav's pages, its arrows and the X menu's icons along the bottom, is the
//! field's `field::subscreen::FieldMenu`'s, whose manager's buttons read 1 throughout: the menu sets
//! its +0x9c while the page has the input, from the bags list on, and draws the frame's icons
//! masked, and a tap on "previous" under the Use panel did nothing. Its manager counts as locked
//! meanwhile.
