//! Choice boxes: announce the field's Yes/No box as it opens and as its cursor moves.
//!
//! When a question in the field has been read and the player presses A, the game puts a small box of
//! options beside the speaker — "Yes" and "No" for Birch's nickname question and his Route 103
//! question. It is not a list window, and it has no vtable (spikes 24 and 26), so no class name finds
//! it. Something it holds has one: the input device manager, `gfl::ui::CTR_DeviceManager`, sits at
//! +0x0c. Every heap word pointing at the manager is a candidate, and the layout is the validator.
//!
//! ```text
//! box   +0x0c -> gfl::ui::CTR_DeviceManager
//!       +0x7c -> entry table: count entries of (u32 value, gfl::str::StrBuf label)
//!       +0x80 u32 cursor row           +0x84 u32 first row shown
//!       +0x88 u32 count                +0x90 s16 state: 0 or 1 opening, 3 up, 4 answered
//! ```
//!
//! At most four rows show (the draw loop at 0x00357d20), and the answer is the entry at the first row
//! shown plus the cursor row (0x003583a8). The box is allocated when A is pressed on the question,
//! reaches state 3 within half a second as it appears, and is freed half a second after the answer.
//! movie3 built it at the same address for three prompts in a row (spike 26).
//!
//! Bound by:
//! - ADR-0012: a choice box says the option under its cursor as it opens, then each moved to.
